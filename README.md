# Soil water balance and penetration resistance modeling


## Description

The main code for simulating soil water balance and soil penetration resistance under water-controlled environments.
The details about the models and the results, as well as other important references are found in [Souza et al. (2020)](doi).

This code was written using [Python 3.7](https://www.python.org/) and requires the fellow libraries:

- [numpy](https://numpy.org/)
- [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)
- [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)

In order to have a better performance, make sure that the latest version of these libraries are installed.
This project is structured as the following:

|Folder or file     |Description                                                             |
|-------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|data               | folder with input data and parameters                                  |
|results            | folder the model outputs will be saved                                 |
|run\_simulation.py | python code to run the simulations                                     |
|spr\_models.py     | python code with the models (module) to be imported during the running |


# Instrunctions

After installing all requirements, place your daily rainfall data and the parameters into the folder **data** different csv files.
Please see the examples files in order to ensure the model will run correctly.
Open the file [run_simulation.py](run_simulation.py) and change the name of your file with data and parameters and save the file.
One it is done, run [run_simulation.py](run_simulation.py) and the results will appear in the folder results.

We do not recommend you to edit [spr_models.py](spr_models.py) unless you want to change the equations.
In any case, it is recommend to backup the project before edit the files.
